### BIOSTAT 216 - Machine Learning in R

This is a repository of assignments that I completed during a three-month course on machine learning methods using R. Each assignment is in the `RMarkdown` format. All required packages are listed in the `{r setup}` code block. Data required for the analyses is given in the .csv format in each folder.

1. **Homework 1:** Regression
2. **Homework 2:** Classification methods and penalization
3. **Homework 3:** Maximum-margin classifiers, classification and regression trees, and bagging
4. **Homework 4:** Boosting, dimension reduction, and clustering
5. **Homework 5:** Using a pretrained neural network with `torch` and `torchvision`
